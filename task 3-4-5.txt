Task 3 & 4 involved making specific changes to a code snippet. On line 72, the direction was to adjust the calculation of taxable income by subtracting deductions rather than adding them. 
Similarly, on line 91, the same change was required for consistency. Additionally, lines 77 and 80 required adjustments to correctly iterate through tax brackets. 
Line 123 needed modification to properly include medical expenses in deductions. 
Lastly, line 94 needed a conditional statement to ensure state taxes don't become negative.

For Task 5, I followed a systematic approach to resolve errors and exceptions. Firstly, I addressed any issues not meeting the requirements. 
Then, I ensured non-negativity of taxable income, mortgage, student loan, and medical expenses. After making these changes, I conducted a dry run to verify the functionality. 
Subsequently, I focused on test cases not yielding expected results, making necessary adjustments to the code until all test cases passed.
